Project for DSC 80 at UCSD. Takes a look at recipes and reviews from users from food.com, and performs data cleaning, EDA, and simple linear regression modeling with data visualizations. 

The website for this project is available at: http://javomode.github.io/recipe-ratings-food.com/

## Introduction:
With thousands of online recipes available, choosing the right one can be overwhelming. This project explores what makes a recipe likely to receive a **high average user rating**, helping people cook smarter and avoid disappointing meals.

I focus on a large dataset from food.com, containing over **230,000 recipes**. My goal is to understand how features like **cooking time**, **number of steps**, and **number of ingredients** relate to a recipeâ€™s rating.

Before dropping and selecting specific values, the dataset that will be used contains 234429, with some relevant columns being:
* 'minutes': the number of minutes a recipe calls for to be made
* 'tags': tags that the author of the recipe used to describe their recipe  
* 'n_steps': the number of steps the recipe uses
* 'n_ingredients': the number of ingredients in the recipe
* 'rating': the rating a single user gave a recipe

## Data Cleaning
1. I merged two datasets, one with recipes and one with user interactions to the recipes. 
2. I replaced ratings of 0 (which indicated no rating was given) with `NaN`, 
	* I replace ratings of 0 with `NaN` because some reviews do not have a rating, yet still receive a 0 as a rating. 
	* I also replace ratings of 0 because it is not possible to leave a 0 star review. 
	* This is important because the lack of a rating is different from the meaning of a rating of 0 stars.
		* If ratings of 0 are left in when they are not possible, then it may skew averages and many other metrics if not replaced.
		* A main reason is that 0 has a meaning, especially when this dataset focuses on looking at predicting rating on certain features.
			* A rating *could* range from 0-5, but food.com only allows full star ratings, from 1-5.
3. I calculated the average rating per recipe after replacing zeroes. 
4. I formatted the nutrition, ingredients, and tags columns to make them easier to work with. 
	* For example, nutrition values were converted from raw strings that looked like lists, actual lists of strings:

| name                                 |     id |   minutes |   contributor_id | submitted   | nutrition                                                                                                                                    |   n_steps |   n_ingredients |   user_id |   recipe_id | date       |   rating |   avg_rating |

#### Univariate Analysis

This bar plot shows the most frequently used ingredients across all recipes in the dataset. Unsurprisingly, common staples like salt, butter, and sugar appear most often, reflecting their widespread use in a variety of recipes.

This bar plot displays the least frequently used tags in the dataset. These rare tags represent niche or highly specific recipe categories and ingredients, a particular one being: Throw the ultimate fiesta with this sopaipillas recipe from Food.com, which is not longer even a tag anymore, but almost a description. The specificity and uniqueness of these tags highlight less common culinary themes or specialized dishes.

#### Bivariate Analysis

This graph details the average rating by binned amounts of minutes that recipes called for.

This graph details the average rating by the number of steps a recipe took.

This graph details the average rating by the number of ingredients a recipe took.

Across all of these graphs, there is not alarming/interesting trend, besides the fact that across all of these distributions, the average rating lied around 4.6-4.7 no matter the number of steps, the number of ingredients, or the number of minutes the recipes called for.

#### Interesting Aggregate
|   n_ingredients |   1.0 |   2.0 |   3.0 |   4.0 |    5.0 |
|----------------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|-------:|
|               1 | nan   |   5   |   5   |  38.4 |   38.6 |
|               2 | 167.1 | 153.7 |  96.9 | 136.9 | 1617.3 |
|               3 |  64.6 | 113   |  69.2 | 378.5 |  144.6 |
|               4 | 187.2 |  39.7 |  57.9 |  64.8 |  248.9 |
|               5 |  81.4 |  63.4 |  62.3 |  59   |   61.8 |

Here, I set the index to the number of ingredients, the columns to the ratings, and the values to the average minutes, and showed only the top 5 rows. This shows the average cooking time for recipes with a given number of ingredients and rating. Under the 5 star rating, there is an obscenely large value of 1617.3 minutes, which suggests there may be outliers of recipes that take large amounts of time to make.

This graph visually shows the pivot table, where for the most part, most of the data makes sense, besides the fact that there is a recipe that takes 37 ingredients, and that there are recipes that are skewing the data with extremely large outliers in the minutes column.
